Massively univariate analysis of face vs house recognition
==========================================================

A permuted Ordinary Least Squares algorithm is run at each voxel in
order to detemine whether or not it behaves differently under a "face
viewing" condition and a "house viewing" condition.
In order to reduce computation time required for the example, only one
brain slice is considered.

The example shows the small differences that exist between
Bonferroni-corrected p-values and family-wise corrected p-values obtained
from a permutation test combined with a max-type procedure.
Bonferroni correction is a bit conservative, as revealed by the presence of
a few false negative.
