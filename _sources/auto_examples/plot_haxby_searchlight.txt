The haxby dataset: face vs house in object recognition using Searchlight
========================================================================

A significant part of the running time of this example is actually spent
in loading the data: we load all the data but only use the face and
houses conditions.

Plus, in order to speed up computing, Searchlight is run only on one slice
od the fMRI (see the generated figures).
